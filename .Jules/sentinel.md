## 2024-05-23 - Referrer Policy for Static Sites
**Vulnerability:** Default browser referrer behavior can leak full URL paths (potentially containing sensitive query parameters) to third-party sites.
**Learning:** Static sites hosted without server configuration access (like .htaccess or _headers) cannot easily set HTTP security headers.
**Prevention:** Use `<meta name="referrer" content="strict-origin-when-cross-origin">` in the HTML `<head>` to enforce privacy at the document level.
